Explanation of changes:

This is a C program to implement a dynamic array with add, delete, and display operations. It uses the following functions:

It declares an array of integers with a maximum size of 100 elements.
It initializes the size of the array to 0.
It enters a loop where it prompts the user to enter a choice (1 to add an element, 2 to delete an element, 3 to display the elements, or 4 to exit).
Depending on the user's choice, it calls the appropriate function.
If the user chooses to exit, the program terminates.
Here is a more detailed explanation of each function:

add_element()
This function first checks if the array is full. If it is, it prints a message to the user and returns. Otherwise, it prompts the user to enter a number to add to the array. It then adds the number to the array at the current index and increments the size of the array.





This function asks the user to input the specific number they want to delete (int numToDelete).

It introduces a found flag to keep track of whether the number to delete was found in the array. Initially, found is set to 0 (indicating "not found").

It then iterates through the array to find the index of the numToDelete using a for loop.

When it finds a match, it shifts the elements to the left to overwrite the found number, effectively deleting it from the array. The found flag is set to 1 (indicating "found").

If the number is not found (found remains 0), it displays a message indicating that the number was not found in the array.

With these modifications, the deleteNumber function will delete the specific number entered by the user rather than requiring an index.
