This C program implements a basic singly linked list data structure with operations to add, delete, and display elements in the list.

1. First, it defines a structure called `node`, which represents a node in the singly linked list. Each node contains an integer value `x` and a pointer to the next node (`next`).

2. It typedefs `struct node` as `nd` for convenience.

3. The `add_element` function is used to add an element to the linked list in sorted order. It takes two parameters: a pointer to a pointer to the head of the list (`nd** head`) and an integer `num` to be added to the list.

   - It allocates memory for a new node using `malloc`.
   - If memory allocation fails, it prints an error message and exits.
   - It initializes the new node with the provided value and sets its `next` pointer to `NULL`.
   - If the list is empty or the new element should be inserted at the beginning (i.e., `num` is less than the current head's value), it inserts the new node at the beginning of the list.
   - Otherwise, it iterates through the list to find the correct position to insert the new node while maintaining the sorted order.

4. The `delete_element` function is used to delete an element from the linked list. It also takes two parameters: a pointer to a pointer to the head of the list (`nd** head`) and an integer `num` to be deleted.

   - It iterates through the list to find the element with the value equal to `num`.
   - If found, it updates the previous node's `next` pointer to skip the current node and then frees the memory of the current node.
   - If the element is not found, it prints a message indicating that the element was not found.

5. The `display_list` function is used to display the elements in the linked list. It takes a pointer to the head of the list (`nd* head`) and prints the elements one by one.

6. In the `main` function, a menu-driven program is implemented to interact with the linked list.

   - It uses a `do-while` loop to repeatedly display a menu and take user input until the user chooses to exit (entering '4').
   - The menu provides options to add an element, delete an element, display the elements, or exit.
   - Depending on the user's choice, it calls the corresponding function (`add_element`, `delete_element`, or `display_list`).

7. After exiting the loop, the program frees the memory allocated for the linked list to avoid memory leaks.

In summary, this program allows the user to create a sorted linked list, add elements to it, delete elements from it, and display the elements in the list. It's a basic implementation of a singly linked list with a simple user interface for testing its functionality.
